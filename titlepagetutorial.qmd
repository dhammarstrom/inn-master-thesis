# Creating and editing a title page

A title page can be added to a quarto book by using an extension with pre-specified formats. The [`quarto_titlepages`](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/quarto_titlepages/) is such an extension.

The full documentation can be found [here](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/quarto_titlepages/), below follows a adopted tutorial to create a INN-styled title page.

## Install the extension

Using the terminal, install the extension to your existing quarto book project by typing:

```
quarto install extension nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages
```

and follow the instructions. This will install the extension making it possibly to use pre-specified title-page themes.

## Updating the `_quarto.yml` file

The pre-specified themes comes with a set of yaml-values that will populate you title page. In the code below the yaml-field of the current book is reproduced. You can copy the code from the `format` line and add to your book.
